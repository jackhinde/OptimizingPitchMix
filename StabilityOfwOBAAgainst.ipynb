    "This project is part of a series of projects where I aim to optimize every pitcher's pitch mix. For this project a pitcher's *pitch mix* is defined as the percentage thrown of each of their pitch types. For example, Cory Abbott's pitch mix in 2022 was 50.9% four-seam fastball, 22.2% knuckle curve, 26.9% slider.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project an *optimal pitch mix* is defined as the pitch mix that minimizes batter success against the pitcher. Batter success against a pitcher and pitcher success is generally complementary, as you can view a plate appearance in the as a matchup of two players with opposite interests. In the broader context of the game the batter wants their team to score runs and the pitcher doesn't want the batter's team to score runs. In the narrower context of a single plate appearance the result of the matchup contributes to both players' broader goals. How much the result of the plate appearance contributes to either player's goal depends on many factors such as the situation in the game and the result of the plate appearance itself. Since determining the level of success attributed to the result of the plate appearance is nuanced, claiming that batter success is exactly complementary of pitcher success is naive. However, it serves as a general benchmark that in a plate appearance the batter is successful if the result is one that contributes positively to their team's run scoring, and the pitcher is successful if they prevent those results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistic that I've chosen to measure pitcher success is *wOBA against* (called *wOBA* from here on). You can read more about wOBA on *Fangraphs* [here](https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reason that I've chosen to use wOBA is that it better represents the value of events to a team's run scoring (or run prevention from the pitching team's perspective) than traditional batting (batting against) statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is that it is inclusive of a larger set of events than traditional pitching stats. Traditional pitching stats like ERA or FIP look at run scoring on a more binary scale than wOBA, and don't reflect the events that contribute to run scoring. For example, a pitcher allowing a double is a negative event for them, but whether that event is reflected in their ERA depends on the events after the double.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third, and final, reason that I've chosen wOBA is that is limited to the results of plate appearances. For a pitcher, getting looking or swinging strikes is generally good and having the batter take balls is generally bad, but their relationship to team run prevention is more complex than the results of a plate appearance."

    "Part of what makes pitchers successful is ensuring that the batter doesn't know what pitch type is coming next. It is likely that if a pitcher throws a pitch type more or less often in a given time period then batters may have different results against that pitch type in that time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "My motivation for this series of projects comes from the understanding that pitchers should throw their best pitch type(s) (in a vacuum, without considering use) as often as they can, but without throwing them too often to the point of increased batter performance against the pitch type(s) due to familiarity."

    "In this project I will determine how stable a pitcher's wOBA becomes as the number of pitches that they throw increases, and I will use these results to select a sample size of pitches to use when modeling how an increase or decrease in use of a pitch type affects that pitcher's wOBA against that pitch type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that I will measure stability is inspired by the work done by Russell Carleton (aka Pizza Cutter) [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20080102094412/http:/mvn.com/mlb-stats/2007/11/14/525600-minutes-how-do-you-measure-a-player-in-a-year/). The measurement of *stability* at a given sample size of pitches is a measure of the [*Pearson correlation coefficient*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) (called *correlation* from here on) between a pitcher's wOBA in the sample that size and their wOBA in all of their other samples of that size. Pitchers who threw a large number of pitches will have many samples to measure correlation between, and as the sample size of pitches increases the number of samples for each pitcher, and in the dataset, will decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between wOBA in samples of pitches is measured within samples only from that pitcher to ensure that I am comparing samples of the same \"true wOBA skill\", and not comparing to a pitcher who may have different \"true wOBA skill\". For this reason, at a given sample size of pitches only those pitchers who have thrown at least twice that number of pitches will be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use a variation of [*split-half*](https://www.statisticshowto.com/split-half-reliability/) sampling when looking at wOBA in a sample of pitches. Across all pitches in the sample for a pitcher, I will create samples by assigning alternating sample numbers to their pitches. For example, if a player threw exactly 1000 pitches and I'm considering samples of 500 pitches, one sample would be all of their odd numbered pitches and their other sample would be all of their even numbered pitches. For pitchers who threw more than two times the number of pitches in the sample size the groups will be alternated in a similar way, their first pitch will be assigned to their first sample, their second pitch to their second sample, their third pitch to their third sample, and continuing until reaching their pitch number that corresponds to their number of samples of the sample size. After reaching this number, their next pitch will be assigned to their first sample, their next pitch to their second sample, and so on. The reason that I'm choosing to sample this way, rather than assigning their first sample size of pitches into the first sample, their second sample size of pitches into their second sample, and so on, is to control for the fact that their \"true wOBA skill\" may change over time. By alternating the groups that the pitches are assigned to, each sample contains pitches from each time period. "

In the *events* column, some events are represented only one way, and others can have multiple ways to represent it. The primary case where this will be relevant is for identifying the end of an at-bat. There are a number of ways that the end of an at-bat is represented in the *events* column, as the end of an at-bat is represented by what happened to end it (i.e a hit, a putout, etc.), so there are many possible results to search for. This also occurs when identifying sacrifice flies, as they are represented differently if the tagging runner is thrown out or not."

    "In this project, wOBA was calculated in samples of pitches. This is not an intuitive sample to use for measuring wOBA, as only the pitches that end a plate appearance have an effect on the pitcher's wOBA in that sample and the pitches in plate appearances that are called or swinging strikes, balls, or foul balls have no effect. If a pitcher had a fewer proportion of pitches ending a plate appearance in a sample (or a pitcher consistently has a high number of pitches per plate appearance), their sample(s) at a given number of pitches may be prone to random error due to small implicit sample size than samples of pitchers with a high proportion of plate appearance-ending pitches. This choice to accept the possibility of random error due to smaller implicit sample size in the samples was an intentional choice in this series of projects to better reflect a pitcher's \"true pitch mix\" of their pitches in the samples. If the samples of pitches were created from pitches that ended plate appearances (equivalent to creating samples of plate appearances), the percentage of each pitch type in the sample would reflect the pitcher's plate appearances by the last pitch thrown, rather than their pitch mix including those that don't often result in an event ending a plate appearance (including, but not limited to, pitch types that are disproportionately used early in the count or pitch types that have a low Contact% and are rarely used with three balls). In measuring the change in wOBA as a consequence of a change in pitch use, which is my application of the results of this project, samples more accurately representing the pitcher's \"true use percentage\" are preferred.\n",

    "To reflect the \"true pitch mix\", and to measure with samples where all data within the sample is used in the statistic, wOBA is not the best choice of measuring performance. A better choice of statistic in this regard is one that reflects the value of non-plate appearance-ending pitches on run scoring (prevention), some examples of these statistics are [Pitch Values](https://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/linear-weights/) and [Pitching+](https://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/stuff-location-and-pitching-primer/). The result of this project, and this series of projects, may serve well to be repeated with a statistic that reflects the effect on run scoring across all pitch scenarios, rather than only by plate appearance-ending events as wOBA does.\n",

    "When creating samples of pitches the number of pitches that each pitcher threw were grouped to create even samples of the sample size, meaning that \"extra\" pitches beyond the number of samples for each pitcher times the sample size were discarded. Inclusion of these discarded pitches wouldn't necessarily create sampling error, though my concern with including these would be that pitchers who threw few more pitches than their even samples would have smaller samples of pitches than pitchers who threw few less pitches than enough to create a new sample of the sample size. For (perhaps an extreme) example, when calculating wOBA in samples of 500 pitches, consider two pitchers, Pitcher A threw 1001 pitches, and Pitcher B threw 1499 pitches. Both pitchers will have two samples of 500 pitches, Pitcher A will samples of size 501 and 500, and Pitcher B will have samples of size 750 and 749. Since the correlation between samples of pitches is stronger as the sample increases, it is reasonable to conclude that a stronger correlation between Pitcher B's samples than Pitcher A's may be explained by the extra pitches and not the stability of wOBA at a sample size of 500 pitches. Though the overall correlation at a sample size likely would not be any weaker when including these discarded pitches (this project used the lower bound of data at each sample size), it was an intentional choice in this project not to need to consider a disproportionately high percentage of pitchers having few less pitches than enough to create a new sample at a given sample size. The result of this project may serve well to be repeated with including these pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of samples decreasing as the sample size increasing was an intuitive result. It appeared that wOBA stabilized as the sample size did, until there became too few samples to reliably compare between-sample correlation for pitchers, then leveled-off and destabilized with an increase in the sample size. Though there are millions of pitches thrown by hundreds of pitchers each season, creating large samples of these pitches for each pitcher rapidly decreases the number of pitchers who have thrown that many, not to mention requiring a pitcher to throw twice the sample for inclusion. It is reasonable to believe that, with an infinite (or at least larger) sample of pitches from each pitcher than available in the 2022 season, wOBA would stabilize further and correlation would increase beyond the values seen in this project. Including data from previous seasons would be a solution to increase the number of pitches in the data for each pitcher. It was an intentional choice in this project to limit the data to the 2022 season, though the choice was made more with the series of projects in mind than this project. The goal of this series of projects is to optimize each pitcher's pitch mix, and part of that process includes establishing the current pitch mix of each pitcher. It is my (unsupported and anecdotal) belief that pitchers are more likely to noticeably alter their pitch mix (by adding a new pitch type, dropping a pitch type, or reimagining and increasing the use of a current pitch type) between seasons than during a season. Altering their pitch mix a substantial amount, by the standards of this project, makes them a different pitcher. Using data over a period that may be more prone to this would introduce unneccessary complexity beyond the initial scope. Should the sample size of 1150 pitches established in this project serve to be a reliable sample for modeling change in wOBA by changing pitch use the trade-off of the smaller sample would be worth it not to be concerned with the possibility of changes in pitch mix beyond what is done in-season. Though the results of this project, and the series of projects may serve well to be repeated with including data from multiple seasons."
